# Pedestrian Detection Project

## Overview
This project uses a pre-trained HOG + Linear SVM model for real-time pedestrian detection in images and videos. It offers high accuracy, customizable confidence thresholds, and easy integration, making it a valuable tool for various applications requiring pedestrian detection.

## Features
- Real-time Pedestrian Detection: Detect pedestrians in real-time using a pre-trained model.
- Accurate Detection: Achieve high accuracy in pedestrian detection with a pre-trained HOG + Linear SVM model.
- Customizable Confidence Thresholds: Adjust confidence levels for pedestrian detection.
- Visual Feedback: Display bounding boxes around detected pedestrians for easy interpretation.
