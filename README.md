# Pedestrian Detection Project

## Overview
This project focuses on pedestrian detection using [insert specific method or model used]. It aims to detect pedestrians in images or videos with high accuracy.

## Features
- Real-time Pedestrian Detection: Detect pedestrians in real-time using a pre-trained model.
- Accurate Detection: Achieve high accuracy in pedestrian detection with a pre-trained HOG + Linear SVM model.
- Customizable Confidence Thresholds: Adjust confidence levels for pedestrian detection.
- Visual Feedback: Display bounding boxes around detected pedestrians for easy interpretation.
